# Microbial eukaryotes: Diversity and Evolution

This is the repository for the **metabarcoding lab** in the microbial eukaryote course at Uppsala University. It is created with [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

Code-folding is possible thanks to [Stackoverflow user SÃ©bastien Rochette](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45360998/code-folding-in-bookdown).

The data used in this lab comes from the [Tara Oceans expedition](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1261605), [Malaspina expedition](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-019-0506-9), [Neotropical forest soils](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0091), and [Lake Baikal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7232311/). Data from the latter three studies was processed by Daniel Vaulot as part of [metaPR2](https://daniel-vaulot.fr/project/metapr2/).
